                <h2>Bhagavad Gita</h2>
                <p>In the Bhagavadgita, Krishna teaches that one can kill only the body; the soul is immortal. At death, the soul is reborn in another body, or, for those who have fully grasped the true teachings, it achieves release (moksha) or extinction (nirvana) that is, freedom from the wheel of rebirth</p>

                <p id="summeryen">The first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita - Arjuna Vishada Yoga introduces the setup, the setting, the characters and the circumstances that led to the epic battle of Mahabharata, fought between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. It outlines the reasons that led to the revelation of the of Bhagavad Gita.\nAs both armies stand ready for the battle, the mighty warrior Arjuna, on observing the warriors on both sides becomes increasingly sad and depressed due to the fear of losing his relatives and friends and the consequent sins attributed to killing his own relatives. So, he surrenders to Lord Krishna, seeking a solution. Thus, follows the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita.",</p>
                <p id="summeryhi">भगवद गीता का पहला अध्याय अर्जुन विशाद योग उन पात्रों और परिस्थितियों का परिचय कराता है जिनके कारण पांडवों और कौरवों के बीच महाभारत का महासंग्राम हुआ। यह अध्याय उन कारणों का वर्णन करता है जिनके कारण भगवद गीता का ईश्वरावेश हुआ। जब महाबली योद्धा अर्जुन दोनों पक्षों पर युद्ध के लिए तैयार खड़े योद्धाओं को देखते हैं तो वह अपने ही रिश्तेदारों एवं मित्रों को खोने के डर तथा फलस्वरूप पापों के कारण दुखी और उदास हो जाते हैं। इसलिए वह श्री कृष्ण को पूरी तरह से आत्मसमर्पण करते हैं। इस प्रकार, भगवद गीता के ज्ञान का प्रकाश होता है</p>

                <p id="info1">Arjuna was one of the five Pandava brothers of royal lineage, whose collective name derives from their father, and heir to the Lunar dynasty, Pandu. However, Pandu was under a curse whereby he would die if he had sexual relations with a woman, and so his sons were born using a mantra given to Kunti by sage Durvasa during her maiden days. His wives—Madri and Kunti—invoked different gods and were also blessed with children.[13] According to the legend, Arjuna was a demigod, who was born as a blessing after his mother Kunti invoked the god Indra on her husband's request.[14][15] The Mahabharata and Puranas such as Devi Bhagavata also records Arjuna as a reincarnation of a rishi called Nara.[16][17]

                    Despite being the younger brother of Dhritarashtra, it was Pandu who succeeded their father as king of Bharata. This was because Dhritarashtra was blind, a disability that caused him to forfeit his right to the royal succession. Dhritarashtra fathered 100 sons, known as the Kaurava brothers, and ascended the throne on the death of Pandu.[18][19] The Pandava brothers were then brought up with their cousins, the Kauravas, and the education of all these boys was supervised by Bheeshma.[20] Among their teachers was the brahmin warrior called Drona, who considered Arjuna to be his favourite.[21] According to Swami Parmeshwaranand, Arjuna was Drona's most accomplished pupil. He notes an incident where Drona deemed that out of all his students, none but Arjuna had the steadfast focus to shoot the eye of a toy bird on a tree using a bow and arrow, and that Drona was proven right.[22]
                    
                    After the princes completed their training, Arjuna defeated Drupada of Panchala, who was impressed by the prince's skills, as the gurudakshina for his beloved teacher Drona.[23] Later, Duryodhana and his maternal uncle Shakuni planned to burn the Pandavas alive along with their mother Kunti. They built a palace out of lac in a village named Varanāvata. The Pandavas, though, managed to escape the house of lac with the help of Vidura through a secret tunnel.[24]</p>

                <p>Bhagavad- Gita is considered by eastern and western scholars alike to be among the greatest spiritual books the world has ever known. In a very clear and wonderful way the Supreme Lord Krishna describes the science of self-realization and the exact process by which a human being can establish their eternal relationship with God. In terms of pure, spiritual knowledge the Bhagavad- Gita is incomparable. Its intrinsic beauty is that its knowledge applies to all human beings and does not postulate any sectarian idealogy or secular view.</p>
